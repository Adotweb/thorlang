# Thorlang 

## Overview 

I build Thorlang (or thor for short) to understand the steps necessary in order to build a interpreted language from the ground up. The endgoal of the project is to have a working programming language that is easy to learn and somewhat efficient... this will take a long time though... 

## Readme info

This project is written and maintained in the scope of a Maturapaper.


## Roadmap
